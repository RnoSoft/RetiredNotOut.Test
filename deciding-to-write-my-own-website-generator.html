<article class="main-area-post">
    <p>Until this website, all my sites were built with Asp.Net Core Razor pages. However, there are problems with this approach, it requires a lot of programming expertise and it’s nigh on impossible for people without these skills to be able to add content to a website. It’s even difficult for me!</p>

<p>For this blog and future websites. I need a new approach. I still want to write the HTML, CSS and Java Script myself, so that I get exactly what I want, and the performance I require (preferable sub-second rendering times). But I need an easier way to publish content, one that doesn’t require programming skills or a knowledge of HTML, CSS and Java Script.</p>

<h2 id="content-management-systems-cms">Content Management Systems (CMS)</h2>

<p>Years ago, I eliminated Word Press as an option, I just didn’t like it, it seemed bloated to me. I still don’t like it and I don’t intend to start using it now. I’ve looked at some of the other Content Management Systems, like Drupal and Joomla, again, I just don’t like them. I guess it’s because I’m a programmer and I love writing code!</p>

<p>I looked at <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and sort of liked it, but it’s expensive, currently $29 a month for a small blog. You can host it yourself (it’s open source); but you need a web server, and the blog is stored on a database, which needs to be backed up. I quickly realised that Ghost wasn’t going to work for me either, even though it could be used as a headless CMS, one of the things that attracted me to it.</p>

<p>CMSs are good because they allow users who have no knowledge of HTML to easily add content to their website, and then publish it. However, I’m concerned about their efficiency and the size of web server needed to run them.</p>

<p>Also, I don’t like the fact that the content is stored in a database, which means that the site’s web pages must be dynamically created on a web server. There can also be issues with backing up the database, something that is very, very important.</p>

<p>Because I’m into writing high performance code and low-cost hosting, CMSs are not the way I wish to go.</p>

<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>

<p>Investigating Ghost led me to Markdown, more about it <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started">here</a>.</p>

<p>I quickly realised that this was what I wanted to use to write content. It means content can be written with a text editor such as Visual Studio Code. Backups won’t be a problem as there is no database (unless you don’t regularly backup the contents of your computer). And there is no need to understand HTML, CSS and Java Script.</p>

<p>There is however, one big problem, converting it into HTML that I could use within my Asp.Net based websites. If this could be done, I could still use Asp.Net to develop a website. But the content could be written independently, allowing people with no programming skills to be able to write it. I needed a markdown parser for the .Net world.</p>

<p>A bit of research found <a href="https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig">MarkDig</a>, a markdown processor written for .Net, it was just what I needed, it was perfect. I also liked the way it was extensible; I can specify my own markdown.</p>

<p>Markdown has a syntax to learn, but it’s not difficult.</p>

<h2 id="static-website-generators">Static Website Generators</h2>

<p>Another problem developing with ASP.NET is the level of skill required to write it. There are a lot of people out there writing small websites, but very few use Asp.Net. This becomes a problem if someone else needs to maintain the website, the new developer also needs to understand Asp.Net and C#.</p>

<p>Around the time I discovered markdown I also came across <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/">static website generators</a>.</p>

<p>These can be used by people who want a website, but do not have the skills needed to write it, and do not have the funds to pay someone to do it. All you need to do is obtain a suitable theme for your site. There are many themes available for the common website generators, some are free, and some must be purchased. Once you have a suitable theme, you then configure it and start writing your content in markdown.</p>

<p>Because I want full control over the look, feel and performance of my websites I want to write my own themes, rather than use other peoples. To do this, you still need an understanding of HTML, CSS and Java Script. You also need to understand the templating language used by the generator. There are a number of these, for example <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/">Go</a> (as used by the Hugo website generator). There is no need to know a complicated programming language like C#, or the .Net Framework.</p>

<p>So, I decided to try one.</p>

<p>The first one I looked at was <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, but I was put off by the Windows 10 installation process. Sorry, but I use Windows 10 and any software that I use, must be installable on that operating system, EASILY. I never got further than the installation page</p>

<p>After a bit of research, I settled on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, it looked good, everyone said it was fast (it was), and was easy to install on Windows. Developing a theme with the Go templating language looked simple enough. The procedures needed to publish posts to the actual website also seemed to be easy enough. I really liked the ability to view my content in a browser as I write it.</p>

<p>I also liked the fact that resultant websites could be hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for free, <em>as long as they are fully static</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I found a number of problems with the templating language and eventually decided that Hugo was no good for me. There is a problem with variable scoping in Go templating language. Also, the only loop was impossible to break out of, continue at the start of, and you can’t even count iterations of it easily. These issues made it hard to write more complex templates.</p>

<p>A big problem was the fact that all URLs had to end with a backslash, and this became a showstopper.</p>

<p>For a new website this might not be a problem, but for an existing website it will. If I went ahead with Hugo, I wanted to move the <a href="https://www.ulverstonfallen.uk/home">Ulverston Fallen</a> website (one I developed) from Asp.Net Core to Hugo. A little bit of research on Search Engine Optimisation showed me that this could be a problem, it seems that Google considers <em>ulverstonfallen.uk/home</em> and <em>ulverstonfallen.uk/home/</em> to be two different web pages. So, for Ulverston Fallen, there must not be a backslash at the end of the URL. Which makes it difficult to use Hugo.</p>

<p>There’s a lot about this issue <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/492">here</a>. OK, I understand some of the arguments, but I live in the real world, and unfortunately, I support a website where URL paths DO NOT END WITH FORWARD SLASH. Surely, it’s not too difficult to make a trailing forward slash optional.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-now">What to Do Now</h2>

<p>I could install Jekyll on my computer and try it. Or I could try one of the other website generators out there, there are many.</p>

<p>After the problems I had with Go, I looked at the Liquid templating language closely and quickly realised that if Hugo had used Liquid (and solved my problem with the URLs), I would have been very happy. And my life would not have gone down the path it’s going now!</p>

<p>At one point it crossed my mind, that it might be a good idea to write my own website generator. Then I would get exactly what I want, not what somebody else thinks I want. If I used Liquid as the templating language, then hopefully my themes could be used with other website generators and vice-versa (either immediately, or with minor changes).</p>

<p>The problem with this approach, is that I would have to write a parser for Liquid, something that would take several months (but would be fun to write, it would also be fun to write a markdown parser). What I wanted was a generator I could use to write the first version of this blog. And I wanted the first version now, not in several months’ time.</p>

<h2 id="enter-fluid">Enter Fluid</h2>

<p>While researching markdown I came across <a href="https://github.com/sebastienros/fluid">Fluid</a>, and everything fell into place. I now had a markdown parser, and a Liquid templating language parser, that could be used in .Net, especially the latest release, release 6. I now have the tools required to build a website generator; all I need to do is design and code it.</p>

<p>It’s at this point that I decided I will write my own website generator.</p>

<p>I see this as a project that’ll take a year or two, depending on how much life gets in the way. Along the way, I’ll be writing about designing and building the generator in this blog.</p>

<p>The project will be open source.</p>

<h2 id="designingbuilding-a-website-generator">Designing/Building a Website Generator</h2>

<p>The problem now is designing and building it.</p>

<p>I want to be able to view the website, in a browser (on the same machine), as I develop its theme and contents. This is important, because I will not have a WYSIWYG editor. The generator will need to be a local web server, accessed by a port on the local host. It will also need to be able to insert Java Script code into a web page, so that changes to the page can be detected. When these occur, the web page will be automatically refreshed to show them.</p>

<p>But what about writing themes, and the markdown? What about the structure of the files making up a theme, and the files containing the content? How should it all work?</p>

<p>This is the difficult part, that I need to think about. I could use the same approach as Hugo or Jekyll, but then I’d just be duplicating what they’ve done. I’m at a very early stage here, I’ll be writing about this in future posts. I know that I’d like my themes to have dynamic menus and some form of Taxonomy (how the pages of a website are connected, classified and organised).</p>

<p>When I wrote the <a href="https://www.ulverstonfallen.uk/home">Ulverston Fallen</a> website I added filtering. This is all done, in the browser, using Java Script and Ajax calls. Apart from the contact page, it’s fully static. I need to be able to add filtering to my themes.</p>

<p>It must also be easy to install and use.</p>

<p>I want to use the generator to build and write content for my blog. I’ll be using this blog and Ulverston Fallen as a test ground for my generator. So, first off, I’m going to write a very basic website generator to give me a feel for MarkDig and Fluid, and a basic blog. Then, over time, I’ll gradually be adding new features, making this blog more and more detailed as I go on.</p>

<p>It <em>will</em> be a niche product. I’m not going to write something that is everything to everybody. It’ll be aimed at small business and personal websites (though I’ll try and make it scalable, so that it can be used with larger websites).</p>

<h2 id="website-generator-ui">Website Generator UI</h2>

<p>Runs on a user’s computer and is used to create/compile a website. It also functions as a <em>local</em> web server so that someone writing content and/or developing a theme, can see the resulting website in a local browser, in real time, as they build it.</p>

<p>In order to run the generator, .Net 6 will need to be installed on your machine. It will not be released until November 2021, until then, the website generator will only be available in prototype form.</p>

<p>A text editor, such as Visual Studio code will also need to be installed.</p>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>

<p>There are many options out there for hosting static websites, some are free and some you must pay for. The one I really like is GitHub Pages, which can be used to host a site for free, even with a domain name. Because GitHub is owned by Microsoft, it’s also secure. The initial version of this blog was hosted on GitHub pages.</p>

<p>My generator will be able to upload pages directly to GitHub Pages.</p>

<h2 id="update-christmas-2022">Update Christmas 2022</h2>

<p>The above post was written in April 2021. I’ve included it in this new version of my blog for historical reasons. This version has been written with prototype 2 of my website generator. There has been a gap of around 18 months, eons in CPU processor time, between releases. When I said the generator was going to take one to two years, I should have said two to three (or even four). But then, everyone who knows me, knows that my time estimates should be filed under fiction in the public library.</p>

<p>The generator is a <em>personal</em> project that allows me to play with cutting edge software, and that is what I have been doing. What I am hoping to achieve is outlined on the <a href="/home">home</a> page of this website.</p>

<p>I’ve been up a few blind alleys. I’ve spent time researching ideas and then discarding them. My ideas for the software have changed. Retirement has got in the way. I’ve learnt a lot.</p>

<p>In my professional programming days, I was always a few releases behind the latest, cutting-edge releases of software. With this project I wanted to be at the forefront. I’ve been using the previews of .Net 6 and 7 as they arrived. Going forward, I’ll be using the previews of release 8 (frozen lists and dictionaries look very useful). Hopefully producing some working software by the time its released in November 2023.</p>

<p>I’m still having fun.</p>
